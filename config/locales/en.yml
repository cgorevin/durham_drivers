      that you can contact them to check on what remaining issues you may need to address or steps
      you need to take to restore your driver’s license.  Ask them what you need to bring with you,
      and how much you will need to pay.  To speak with someone at the DMV, please call (919) 715-7000.
      Sometimes it can take the DMV a little while to process all of the paperwork from the courts.
      If you call them before going to a DMV location, you can also check to make sure the relief you
      received is reflected in their records."
