<p>
  Dear <%= full_name %>:
</p>

<p>
  This project is staffed by the Durham Expungement and Restoration (“DEAR”) program in collaboration with the Durham District Attorney’s Office. Our goal is to provide relief to people who have had a suspended driver’s license for more than two years due to unresolved traffic tickets in Durham County that do not involve DWIs or other “high risk” traffic offenses.
</p>

<p>
  We are excited to inform you that the Durham District Attorney’s office has dismissed the following traffic <%= fta_tickets %>:
</p>

<ul>
  <% ftas.each do |x| %>
    <li>Full name: <%= x.name %>. Case number: <%= x.case_number %>.  Charge description: <%= x.description %></li>
  <% end %>
</ul>

<p>
  We are excited to inform you that the Durham County court has eliminated all unpaid fines and/or fees for the following traffic <%= ftp_tickets %>:
</p>

<ul>
  <% ftps.each do |x| %>
    <li>Full name: <%= x.name %>. Case number: <%= x.case_number %>.  Charge description: <%= x.description %></li>
  <% end %>
</ul>

<p>
  All tickets identified above have been resolved. Any suspensions of your driver’s license caused by the specific tickets being unresolved have ended. Although the fines and/or fees  for the tickets identified above have been eliminated and the tickets are no longer causing your license to be suspended, this does not mean that you are now legally able to drive. There may be other traffic matters that are causing your license to remain suspended. If there are no other traffic matters causing your license to be suspended, then you will need to pay a reinstatement fee to the NCDMV in order to reinstate your license. For more information about the status of your driver’s license and/or procedures to reinstate a driver’s license, please call the NC Division of Motor Vehicles (NC DMV) at (919) 715-7000.
