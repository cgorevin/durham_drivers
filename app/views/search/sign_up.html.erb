<p>
  We are glad to inform you that you are eligible to receive an additional free legal service through the DEAR Program. If you complete the registration form below, the DEAR Program will obtain and review your state driving record to identify all reasons your license is currently suspended, including issues that occurred in other counties. If you do not have any other suspensions, the record will indicate that you are now eligible to reinstate your driverâ€™s license. An attorney with the DEAR Program will draft an advice letter for you explaining the information contained in the driving record and send it to you within six weeks. When you receive this advice letter, you will have an opportunity to sign-up to attend a DEAR clinic where you will be able to speak directly with an attorney about your case.
